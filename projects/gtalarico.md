This website was built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
Hugo is a very fast and easy-to-use static site generator written in Go. Deployment is automated from repo changes and is and hosted on [Netilify](https://www.netlify.com/)

It uses a slightly mofified version of the theme [Hugo-Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/),
a minimalist hugo template.
